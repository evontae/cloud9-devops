# Notes

## Observations

1. Chose **cloud9** as the name mainly for simplicity — easy to type and easy to navigate.
2. Did some Googling around setting up SSH and global Git config.
3. I know there’s a command to recursively create directories, but I built everything manually, one by one.
4. Mostly relied on the provided template as a starting point.
5. I was pretty unsure about how to properly set up the `.gitignore` file and spent more time than expected researching it.
6. Even with examples and references, I still needed AI help to get the `.gitignore` right.

## Helpful Items

### `.gitignore` File Patterns and Format

- **Blank line** — used to separate entries for readability  
- **#** — denotes a comment (use `\#` to match a literal `#`)  
- **/** — directory separator (e.g. `webdev/` ignores the `webdev` directory at the repo root)  
- **`*.extension`** — matches all files with a given extension (e.g. `*.txt`, `*.log`)  
- **`**/name`** — matches any file or directory named `name` at any level  
- **`name/**`** — matches all files and subdirectories inside `name`

## Ticket Details

1. I spent a couple of hours working through this ticket.
2. Most of the time was spent reviewing each step and figuring out how to complete it. Some parts were more of a refresher, like setting up SSH keys and creating the GitHub repo.
3. I learned how to write Markdown — or at least got the basics down well enough to document things clearly.
4. The `.gitignore` was the most challenging part and was the area where I needed the most AI assistance.
