# Notes


## Observations

1. I decided on cloud9 for the name to make it easier for navigation and typing
2. Did some Googling on setting up SSH and the git config global
3. I know there is a command to recursively build directories but I built this the slow way one by one
4. Mostly used the template provided
5. I was very unsure of how to get the gitignote file going and spent quite some time looking this up
6. Even with helpful items I still needed AI assistance to get the gitignore done correctly.


## Helpful Items

> #### .gitignore File Patterns and Format

> Blank line: Used to separate entries for readability.
> #: Denotes a comment. Use \# to match a literal #.
> /: Directory separator. Example: webdev/ ignores the webdev directory at the root.
> *.extension: Matches all files with a specific extension (e.g., *.txt, *.log).
> **/name: Matches any file or directory named name at any level.
> name/**: Matches all files and subdirectories inside name

### Ticket Details

1. I have spent a couple hours working through this ticket
2. For the most part I had to review and figure out how to complete each step. There were some steps where it was 
more of a refresher such as setting up SSH key and creating the github repo.
3. I learned how to write MD or at least I was able to get some basic syntax down for writing it
4. The gitignore was difficult and that was an item that I really had to get AI help with
