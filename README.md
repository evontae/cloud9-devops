# Cloud9 DevOps - 12-Block Engineering Program

## About This Repository

This repository documents my engineering journey using AI as both a mentor and a simulated employer. The goal is to model an apprentice-level role (Cloud9) by working through real tickets that mirror day-to-day engineering work.

Each task is intentionally designed to force hands-on learning—building, breaking, fixing, and gaining real-world experience rather than just theory. The structure consists of 12 initial foundational blocks, divided into three parts. Below, I break down what each block covers and how they build on one another.

## Learning Goals

- Linux system administration and scripting
- Kubernetes orchestration and troubleshooting
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- AWS cloud architecture and services
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Docker containerization
- Python and Bash automation
- Monitoring and observability
- Security best practices
- Production incident response
